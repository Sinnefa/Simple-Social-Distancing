# Simple-Social-Distancing
A concept android application to count nearby discoverable bluetooth devices to facilitate social distancing against COVID

# WARNING
This is just a concept application, it is not mean to be an official app against COVID.

# Description
This application continuously scans for nearby discoverable bluetooth devices. It shows how many devices are around you in time.
Due to the pandemic (year 2020) I developed this app to show that it is possible to estimate how many interactions you have during the day. By reducing this number, looking at the interface, you can reduce your interactions through the days and possible reduce the chance of being infected.

Looking at these numbers one can try to keep them as low as possible
