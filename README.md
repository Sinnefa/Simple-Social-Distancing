# Simple-Social-Distancing

Estimate the bluetooth interactions around you so you can try to keep it as small as you can, as if it was a game.
Try to reduce alecromagnetic fields around you.

A concept android application to count nearby discoverable bluetooth devices to play social distancing.
If anyone knows or wants to further implement this idea here is how it works:

1. Give the user an estimate of any "bluetooth activity" around at the moment to help him/her reduce it
2. Give the user an estimate of how many "human activities" around you you met on average in the past days
3. In the future days, help the user to keep it numbers lower than previous days
4. It is a matter of probability, the less people you meet the less probable it is that you get in alecromagnetic fields

# Description
Unlike other apps, this app scans for any possible contact just to help you reduce the chance of encountering bluetooth magnetic fields.
This application continuously scans for nearby discoverable bluetooth devices. It shows how many devices are around you in time.
I developed this app to show that it is possible to estimate how many interactions you have during the day. By reducing this number, looking at the interface, you can reduce your interactions through the days.

# WARNING
This is just a concept application, it is not meant to be an official app against magnetic fields.
* The app doesn't use internet, data will never leave you device. Position included (Coarse position is not localization anyway)
* Constant use of the apps drains battery
* One bluetooth devices does not mean one person
* Bluetooth distance is not the "safe distance"
* Bluetooth is very limited and a very rough approximation of this idea to work properly.
