# Simple-Social-Distancing

Estimate the number of interactions around you so you can try to keep it as small as you can, as if it was a game.

A concept android application to count nearby discoverable bluetooth devices to facilitate social distancing against COVID.
A graph theory based computer simulation I made to show the benefits of social distancing: https://youtu.be/Nwrh_Vm4TpE
If anyone knows or wants to further implement this idea: "Give the user an estimate of any contact around to help him/her reduce it" fell free to clone this project or contact me again.

# WARNING
This is just a concept application, it is not mean to be an official app against COVID.
* The app doesn't use internet, data will never leave you device. Position included (Coarse position is not localization anyway)
* Constant use of the apps drains battery
* One bluetooth devices does not mean one person
* Bluetooth distance is not the "safe distance" suggested by the law of your country
* Bluetooth is very limited and a very rough approximation of this idea to work properly.

# Description
Unlike other apps, this app scans for any possible contact just to help you reduce the chance of encountering someone infected with COVID.
This application continuously scans for nearby discoverable bluetooth devices. It shows how many devices are around you in time.
Due to the pandemic (year 2020) I developed this app to show that it is possible to estimate how many interactions you have during the day. By reducing this number, looking at the interface, you can reduce your interactions through the days and possible reduce the chance of being infected.

Looking at these numbers one can try to keep them as low as possible
